# weather-dashboard
 
When the user enters the name of a city into the search field and clicks the search button an api is fetched based on that city's name. The longtitude and latitude information from this api is then used to fetch a different API that has the weather information as well as a forcast of the weather of the coming week. This data is then used to display the current weather in the searched city as well as a 5 day forcast. The city's name is then saved in local storage as well as displayed on the webpage as a button that can be used to initiate another search of that city's weather forecast. 

In addition there is a clear history button that removes all the stored names in local storage and subsequently refreshes the page. Thank you.
